Another is to store your cheese in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight and exposure to air.  You can also put your cheese in a sealed container in the refrigerator, which will preserve it.  Another way is to purchase and store cheese in a sturdy container, which will keep it dry and prevent mold from developing.  Another option is simply to wash your cheese regularly to remove any mold.

The paper towel will help the lettuce absorb some of the dirt, and the plastic sheet will also give the lettuce a durable surface.  You can then remove the lettuce from the paper towel and wash it with a mild dish soap or household cleaner.

      "\n",
      "Assistant: It depends on the color of the marker and how you carry it around.  Some markers fade faster than others.  If you’re using a blue or green marker, you might want to take extra care not to use it near water or other sources of humidity.  And also, if the marker has a little bit of shine on it, it’s possible that it’s sitting on something that can fade the marker.  So, if you’re using a blue or green marker, you might want to take extra care not to sit it on something that shows a lot of light or that has a lot of shine.  And also if it’s sitting on a surface where the dry-erase marker is rubbing with the page surface, be sure that it’s sitting on a smooth, even surface, instead of a surface where you might brush the marker back and forth.  You might also want to try to keep the dry-erase marker in a dry, dark place.  So, if you’re concerned that it might fade, I recommend taking extra care when you write on a surface that could show a lot of light or that has a lot of shine.<|endoftext|>\n",
